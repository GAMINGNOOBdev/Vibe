# Vibe

This is a psp rhythm game project that randomly came into my mind while i was pressing random buttons (and triggers) to the music.

## How to build
Ensure you have the [pspdev toolchain](https://pspdev.github.io/installation.html) installed.<br>
After that just run `make`.

## How to game
Currently don't.

## How to add beatmaps
Currently just create a `Songs` folder at the root of the repo and extract and put .osz files into it.<br>
Ensure that you extract to a folder with the name of the osz file.<br>
Folders have to be in the format `<id> <artist> - <title>` in order to be detected by the game.
